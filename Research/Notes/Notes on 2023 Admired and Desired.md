Going through the most admired and desired languages from Stackoverflow's 2023 survey in order and writing down my immediate thoughts on the language.

1. JavaScript - Not interested in front-end work, and the language is poorly planned and implemented.
2. Python - Great for whipping something up fast, which I used less of it at work
3. Typescript - JavaScript but with types? I'm not super impressed by the idea
4. SQL - Love it, most dialects anyway
5. Rust - Frustrating to learn, spent a lot of time fighting with the compiler
6. C# - Java but smoother imo
7. Go - Love it. Super simple and easy. That being said, sometimes the simplicity bites you in the ass when you want to do something that should be easy and isn't
8. Java - Get's a bad rep because there are a lot of bad developers and java is a popular language. It's fine
9. C++ - Getting better, linker errors scare me still
10. Kotlin - Java but smooth
11. C - Simple, easy, good times
12. PHP - No experience really. Only memes
13. Dart - I've heard very good things but I'm not interested in frontend
14. Swift - I really dislike iOS products, so I avoid this just because it is stained by apple
15. Ruby - Too much magic but elegant syntax
16. Lua - I really dislike it for some reason? The language just doesn't jive with me
17. Elixir - Excited to learn, intrigued by concurrency, low latency
18. Assembly - Party like it's 1965
19. Zig - I like go, maybe I'll like zig? I'll wait for more community support
20. Haskell - Stopped me from burning out in college. This is what programming should be
21. R - Good lang, python better
22. Scala - Not sure really. I'd like to explore it more
23. Julia - This one is really exciting, it's just slow moving and there is little community support
24. F# - C# but functional, I'm very excited by this but it's
