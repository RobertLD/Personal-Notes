Going through the most admired and desired languages from Stackoverflow's 2023 survey in order and writing down my immediate thoughts on the language.

1. JavaScript - Not interested in front-end work, and the language is poorly planned and implemented.
2. Python - Great for whipping something up fast, which I used less of it at work
3. Typescript - JavaScript but with types? I'm not super impressed by the idea
4. SQL - Love it, most dialects anyway
5. Rust - Frustrating to learn, spent a lot of time fighting with the compiler
6. C# - Java but smoother imo
7. Go - Love it. Su[]
