## Goodreads
I'll be maintaining a separate but similar list on good-reads to keep track of which books I should read next. As well as what books I read and how I liked them. https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/174644725-robert-derienzo


### Book Notes
I feel like it's important to take some semblance of notes about the books I read to remember what they were supposed to be teaching me. These notes can be found here
