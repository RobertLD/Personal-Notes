## Introduction
January has been an interesting month in regard to personal development. Both in my work life and otherwise. I've taken some time to focus on things outside of programming, which is a bit out of the norm for me personally. 


## 1. Yoga
I watched an excellent video from [Tris@NoBoilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gZdTZa8bOw) about conquering common health problems that software developers face as a direct result of their day jobs. The most relatable for me was his discussion of a constantly racing mind and back/neck pain from long coding sessions.

In the video, he made a brilliant connection between the original purpose of yoga and how it relates to software work. To summarize, yoga was designed as a way of enhancing the human body’s ability to sit in meditation for long periods of time. It's not too far of stretch to connect this to sitting at our desk for 12 hours a day.


Inspired by this, I’ve been trying to add a nightly yoga routine to my daily life. Although I haven’t yet seen the benefits, I do notice that my body always feels better and more energetic afterward. I’d like to do some more research on this topic to make it a regular part of my life. I’d like to extend a big thank you to NoBoilerPlate for being a huge inspiration in this regard.

I'd like to do some additional reading on this topic to make it a more regular part of my life at some point. I'd also like to extend a big thank you to [NoBoilerPlate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate) here for being a huge inspiration in this regard.
