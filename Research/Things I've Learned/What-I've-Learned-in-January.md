## Introduction
January has been an interesting month in regard to personal development. Both in my work life and otherwise. I've taken some time to focus on things outside of programming, which is a bit out of the norm for me personally. 


## 1. Yoga
I viewed an excellent video from [Tris@NoBoilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gZdTZa8bOw) about conquering common health problems software developers struggle with as a direct result of their day jobs. The most relatable for me being his discussion of a constantly racing mind, and back/neck pain from long coding sessions. 

In the video he made a really excellent connection between the original purpose of yoga and how that could connect to our day jobs. To summarize, yoga was designed as a means of enhancing the human body's ability to sit in prayer for long periods of time. This is analogous to sitting at our desk for 12 hours a day.

Having reflected on this, I've been recently trying to add a nightly Yoga routine to my daily life. Although I haven't yet begun to reap the benefits, I do notice that my body always feels better and more energetic afterward. I'd like to do some additional reading on this topic to make it a more regular part of my life. I'd like to extend a big thank you to [NoBoilerPlate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate) here for being a huge inspiration in this regard.
