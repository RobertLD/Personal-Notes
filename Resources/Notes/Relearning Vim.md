### Relearning Vim
The intrigue of learning vim for increased productivity isn't lost on me, and I've been swayed by the number of popular software influencers that heavily push vim as the definitive way to edit code. I've tried switching from VSCode to vim, neovim and even a set of different Emacs distributions.

I'm one of those fools that seeks out "tool productivity", which is something I preach against; but the allure of squeezing out that extra 5% productivity is too great. That instinctual desire to maximize productivity coupled with the fact that I've developed carpal tunnel in my right wrist by the ripe age of 25 brings me back once again, to the land of keyboard driven editing.

There are a number of keyboard driven text-editors some of them more popular than others. This brings me back to square one, which one to choose, how to hit jogging speed, and how to integrate it into my workflow daily to get that extra five percent productivity gain. The way I normally make these decisions is through the use of a decision matrix with some sort of weight set for my personal desire for certain aspects. We're going to keep it simpler than that and instead integrate Vim motions directly in my current editor.

Vscode offers the ability to integrate vim motions directly in the editor through the use of the [VsCodeVIM](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) plugin. I've been there before and found myself editing text significantly slower, and struggling to remember the motions when working through my code-base.

This time we'll attempt to use it outside of work setting, on personal projects to alleviate some pressure from the endeavor and focus on the core set of motions with the goal of getting "up to jogging speed" as quickly as possible. I'll need a cheat-sheet of sorts for easy reference for important VIM commands. The issue with the number of cheat-sheets online is that their breadth of content is simply too large.

Throughout relearning vim, I'll compose a tiny me-focused cheat sheet with just what I need for this moment. I'll edit the bottom of this note to include my simple cheat sheet as I design it
