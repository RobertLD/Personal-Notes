## MVVM
### Movel-View-Viewmodel

#### Model
Handles data, external apis, etc.
This would be most similar to a Controller that you are already familiar with

#### ViewModel
This is the bridge between the model and the view. All state in general is stored within the ViewModel

#### View
This is where the user screen is drawn. The UI is displayed here from the model
