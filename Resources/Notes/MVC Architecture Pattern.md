MVC is a common organizational pattern for web-services. The primary purpose is to make the code more organized by splitting it into three sections
1. Model
2. View
3. Controller

### Model
Essentially the data layer. The model layer is responsible for database interaction and data serialization

### View
The view constructs the presentation that the user is displayed

### Controller
The controller is a linking layer between the model and view layer. Business logic tends to live within the controller
