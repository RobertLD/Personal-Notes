## Introduction
This repository contains my personal notes on various topics that I find interesting, such as programming, science, history, etc. I use this repository to store and organize my notes, as well as to share them with others who might find them useful. 

## Embedded Blog
My blog is also embedded as a submodule in the /Blog folder. Although I don't consider myself a blogger, I'd like to give myself the ability if I ever decide to.
