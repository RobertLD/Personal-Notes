### Relearning Vim
The intrigue of learning vim for increased productivity isn't lost on me, and I've been swayed by the number of popular software influencers that heavily push vim as the definitive way to edit code. I've tried switching from VSCode to vim, neovim and even a set of different Emacs distributions.

I'm one of those fools that seeks out "tool productivity", which is something I preach against; but the allure of squeezing out that extra 5% productivity is too great. That instinctual desire to maximize productivity coupled with the fact that I've developed carpal tunnel in my right wrist by the ripe age of 25 brings me back once again, to the land of keyboard driven editing.

There are a number of keyboard driven text-editors some of them more popular than others. This brings me back to square one, which one to choose, how to hit jogging speed, and how to integrate it into my workflow daily to get that extra five percent productivity gain.
