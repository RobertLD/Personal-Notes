## Daily Tasks
Tasks to complete today
- [x] Add a couple projects to the project list on the blog
- [x] Start implementing vim motions in obsidian
	- Vim mode is a bit strange in obsidian. It appears that it doesn't tell you what mode your in which stinks kind of?
- [x] Install a better theme than the default (cappucine?)
## Other Tasks
Tasks to work on, start or otherwise think about today

## Notes

- Installed Omnivore today, seems to be a really good application for keeping a living web-reading list. I added the folder here [[Epigrams in Programming - Computer Science | Omnivore]].
- Recently installed a new font that I like and will be using in my Obsidian from now on [JetBrainsMono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
